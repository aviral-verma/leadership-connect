					<ul class="para">
						<li>Occurence of the Market rate activity affects the interest rate. 
						</li>
						<li>Interest rate directly varies with the monetary policy adopted by the RBI
						</li>
						<li>
							In line with the RBI Governor’s policy as far as the repo rate is concerned
						</li>
						<li>India has seen a repo rate cut consecutively for the last one year. It has come down to a level of 4%
						</li>
						<li>RBI wants the inflation rate to be more in control, Enough funds to be available to the banks and the industries for fuelling economic activity
						</li>

					<h4 style="text-align: left;">CUSTOMER LIFE CYCLE - LIFE CYCLE BASED SALES APPROACH
					</h4>
					<ul class="para">
						<li>During the life cycle of the FD, we try to build trustful relationship with the customers by providing quality services.
						</li>
						<li>It is important to build good relationship with the customers because once the FD is matured, we do not have any contact with the customers unlike banks who frequently tries to cross sale other products because the customer has a current/saving bank account so it is very easy for them to be in constant touch with the customers.
						</li>
						<li>
							Quality services ensure that a trustful relationship builds between us and the customers so that they come back to us again in future when they have some money to invest or even renew the FD in case they do want to use the money.
						</li>

					</h4>	
					<ul class="para">
						<li>More from a macro economic point of the whole banking and nbfc sector

						</li>
						<li>More concerned about FIIs and equity investment - country outlook looks bad. Indian sovereign rating is itself BBB- rating by the S&P Global.

						</li>
						<li>
							Retail investors are more concerned with crisil rating which has given bfl the highest rating
						</li>
						<li>Within nbfc everything is not bad. There are companies like bfl who have high cash flow. 

						</li>
						<li>Not impacted BFL
						</li>
						<li>Customers are satisfied when explained about the balance sheet, moratorium of only 15%, very low NPA, very high growth rate for the last 10 years

					</h4>
					<ul class="para">
						<li>BFL provides loan against Fixed Deposits of upto 75% of the principal deposit 
						</li>
						<li>The interest rate for such loans is 2% more than that offered on deposit
						</li>
						<li>BFL has capped the loan at 75% of deposit as per the Circular from RBI
						</li>
						<li>Banks provide loan against Fixed deposits of upto 90% of the principal deposit because banks have liquidity from Current and Savings accounts also apart from the term deposits. 
						</li>
						<li>The 75% cap ensures that there is no ALM (Asset Liability Mismatch).
						</li>

					<h4>Market Disruption
					</h4>
					<ul class="para">
						<li>Fixed Deposit is a vanilla product, regulated by RBI so there is very little scope to customize the product.

						</li>
						<li>So, we can only customize our services by providing quality services, creating customer convenience and reducing our various costs by adopting digitalization such as chatbots, self servicing platforms, digital payments etc.

						</li>
						<li>
							Our 3in1 Super App is one of the steps taken to disrupt the market.
